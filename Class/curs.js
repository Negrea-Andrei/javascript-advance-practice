//!CLASS in JS
//*In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for 
//*state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
class MyClass {
    // class methods
    constructor() { }
    method1() { }
    method2() { }
    method3() { }
}
//*Then use new MyClass() to create a new object with all the listed methods.
//*The constructor() method is called automatically by new, so we can initialize the object there.

//!What is a class?
