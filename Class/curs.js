//!CLASS in JS
//*In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for 
//*state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).
class MyClass {
    // class methods
    constructor() { }
    method1() { }
    method2() { }
    method3() { }
}
//*Then use new MyClass() to create a new object with all the listed methods.
//*The constructor() method is called automatically by new, so we can initialize the object there.

//!What is a class?
//*In JavaScript, a class is a kind of function.
class User {
    constructor(name) { this.name = name; }
    sayHi() { alert(this.name); }
}

// proof: User is a function
alert(typeof User); // function

//!What class User {... } construct really does is:
//*1)Creates a function named User, that becomes the result of the class declaration. The function code is taken from the constructor method(assumed empty if we donâ€™t write such method).
//*2)Stores class methods, such as sayHi, in User.prototype.
