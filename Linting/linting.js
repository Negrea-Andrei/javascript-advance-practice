/*Before we dive all the way into the Code, we are going to take a moment to improve your editor setup. Doing this now will make things much easier for you going forward.
This lesson will give you some information about code style, and then give you some tools to help you maintain consistent code-style throughout your projects.
In some cases it can even help adjust things like indentation for you!*/

//!The style guides we mentioned above are full of really helpful advice for formatting, organizing and composing your code. But there are a lot of rules - it can be difficult to internalize them all. 
//!Linters are tools that will scan your code with a set of style rules and will report any errors to you that they find. In some cases, they can even auto-fix the errors! 
//!The following articles explain in more detail the benefits of using a linter while you code.

//*Image slider

/*Again, there’s not much instruction needed here - just practice.  

Create a simple image carousel. It should contain arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backward. It should automatically move forward every 5 seconds. 
It should contain the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on (and they should be click-able to advance to that particular slide).

Don’t spend too much time worrying about getting your images to display at the correct size – it’s more important to get the slider sliding.

This one is a little more involved than the last two, so think about how you would set up the different elements within the site.  
Set up a very wide div which will contain the individual “slides” of each image. By appropriately positioning that div inside a container div (which acts like a picture frame), you can choose which slide is visible at any given time.
Once you have the slider positioned properly, build functions for “next” and “previous” which will advance to the next or previous slide accordingly. Make the transitions smooth using simple effects.
Set up arrow buttons which activate those functions and play with cycling through the images.
Add in some navigation dots at the bottom of the slides. Make a horizontal series of empty circles with CSS immediately below the slideshow. Each circle represents a slide, so whenever a new slide is activated, its corresponding circle gets filled in so you can tell where in the show you are. Make each circle link to that particular slide, so you can click on the circle and it will jump to that slide.
Add a timeout which advances the slides every 5 seconds.
Play around with your slideshow!*/
